RGB is confidential & scalable client-validated smart contracts for Bitcoin &
Lightning. It embraces the concepts of private & mutual ownership, abstraction
and separation of concerns and represents "post-blockchain", Turing-complete
form of trustless distributed computing which does not require introduction of
"tokens". To learn more about RGB please check [RGB website][Site].

This repository provides client-facing library which can be used by desktop
apps and mobile wallets for integrating RGB support. It also provides binary
`rgb` which runs in the command-line and exposes all RGB functionality locally,
requiring only an indexer, check [here](/cli/README.md) for details.
